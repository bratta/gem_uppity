This gem is probably a bad idea.

The code needs love. It needs specs. It needs better ways of doing things like how it shells out to the `gem` command to search for the latest version of the gem on Rubyforge.

It works for my use case, but it might/will fail for you if your Gemfile is more complicated than the I designed this for.

This is a long way of saying that your mileage may vary.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gem_uppity'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gem_uppity

## Usage

You can call it with a path to a `Gemfile`:

```bash
$ gem_uppity /path/to/Gemfile > Gemfile.new
```

The `Gemfile` needs to have been used and a `Gemfile.lock` needs to have been generated by a call to `bundle install` beforehand.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the path beforehand:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/my/bundler/project
$ gem_uppity > Gemfile.new
$ 
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
